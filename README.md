# Autismo

We have developed a platform to track behavioral patterns of Autistic children for better cure and diagnosis by parents and doctors.


About 1 in 59 children has been identified with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) according to estimates from CDCâ€™s Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network done in USA 2019.

We aim at solving these problems:

Sleep Tracking: An in-depth information showing the sleep data of the autistic child for doctors and parents.

Behaviour Tracking: Our hardware checks for the Positive phase and disordered phase of the child.

Emergency Details: Our app has a details section with details of the autistic children to help in a medical emergencies.
